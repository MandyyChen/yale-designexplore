**Explore Yale’s design scene one step at a time.**  

This project is an interactive, browser-based zine that turns Yale’s campus into a playful map you can explore.  
Move your avatar to discover hotspots like CEID, CCAM, STC, DFA, and design-related classes.  
Each hotspot reveals quick, fun info about spaces, clubs, and opportunities to get involved.  

No long brochures. No endless links. Just **walk, bump, and explore.**
